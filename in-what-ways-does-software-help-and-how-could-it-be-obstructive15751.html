<p>It is no secret, that technology has evolved through the years at a staggering pace. From punchcards, to
modern day coding using IDEs, software has come a long way decade after decade. But how can a few lines of
code help us in everyday life? Well, we can look no further than our everyday life! Nowadays, we are so accustomed
to using tools, platforms etc that do things unimaginable 50 years prior. Now, communication is just a tap away
, shopping is just a few clicks, and much more things have become easier through the integation of software
into our lives. Mostly gone are the days of standing in a line to pay the bills as we now can pay online,
talking to a relative or friend overseas fearing for the cost of the phone bill or trying to find an answer
in books, asking people and such with the introduction of search engines like Google. The introduction of
software and machinery in healthcare has seen the rise of robotic surgery, telemedicine and more services aiming
to serve patients independently of their geographic location. Farming also has benefited from software as
agriculture software can centralize, manage and optimize the operation of a farm, lending a hand to many
agriculture workers and farmers in an effort to provide a better production of their respective product.
Autopilots have become much more prominent in use during the last few years, as we see many more self-driving
cars on roads, helping drivers on long journeys as they now can rest while the car is driving safely itself
to the selected destination using sensors, software, cameras and GPS. In the airline industry, software has
become an irreplaceable integral part of each aircraft. Autopilots, warning systems like GPWS, TCAS, engine
monitoring and advisories to airmen are parts of an aircraft that flying without would be outright dangerous
and deadly. For example, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) measures the aircrafts radio altitude
relative to the mean sea level and can warn pilots if there is terrain ahead, or if the aircraft is very
close to the ground. The Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) can warn two or more aircraft at the same
time if they are on a collision course mid-air and gives instructions to both aircraft like &ldquo;Traffic ahead,
ascend, ascend now&rdquo; to one aircraft and &ldquo;Traffic ahead, descend, descend now&rdquo; to the other aircraft so as to
avoid a collision. It is truly amazing what some lines of code can do to save lives!</p>

<p>&hellip;But could software replace us, be invasive or cause trouble?
Well, automation has began replacing people&rsquo;s jobs for a number of years now. Take for example a car manufacturing plant.
In these days, it is common for robotic arms and such to assemble car parts as a machine can do a more precise work than
a human counterpart, be faster and cost less, about what every manufacturer wants to for his business. Automatic check counters
at supermarkets have replaced counter clerks and there has been a rise in automated supermarkets, with no workers whatsoever.
So software has begun fading out jobs that would otherwise have to be worked by a human worker, which can lead to severe
unemployment because it is much more efficient for a machine to do a human&rsquo;s work. In the future, AI is projected to take
lots of jobs away from people, causing some turmoil about how ethical is it for a machine to replace a person.</p>

<p>Can software be invasive? Yes, in some ways. Malware, spyware and other malicious software can act on your behalf, spy on you
or outright lock your system and ask for ransom to unlock it. But in aircraft, a prominent case, was the MCAS. This
system was designed to correct an aircraft&rsquo;s angle of attack in case it got too steep and was used in the Boeing 737 MAX. The
result was two airplane crashes which were directly linked with this system, as a AOA sensor had malfunctioned, sending erroneous data
about the AOA to the system thus making it believe that the plane was about to stall. So, while the plane was flying perfectly normal,
the MCAS system automatically pushed its nose down to correct a non-existing steep angle, and the system was on for 10 seconds and off for
5, in a repetitive cycle, overriding the pilot&rsquo;s inputs, with the captains having no way to disable it because they weren&rsquo;t briefed
by the manufacturer about the system&rsquo;s existence, thus having no knowledge of it being active.</p>

<p>Can it cause trouble? Also yes. In 2003, the Northeast blackout occured. Specifically, parts of the Northeastern
and Midwestern United States along with parts of Ontario, Canada suffered an extended power outage due to a software
bug in FirstEnergy&rsquo;s alarm system. What happened, was that in the Middle of August the temperature was high as normal
for the season, so air-conditioners were working overtime. That meant that load demand was high also, causing some major
lines to expand and sag into trees causing short circuits. But due to the software bug, operators were unaware of these
short circuits and the need to redistribute loads into other lines to prevent this overloading, so in the course of an hour,
the excessive electrical loads found other passage through the other major lines causing them to fail in succession in a
similar manner. What could have been a local blackout turned into a widespread blackout, with problems arising such as
people trapped in the subway as no electricity was there to power the trains, communication problems, and no air conditioning
in a hot night among other significant problems. Although this was fixed later on, an irreversible damage caused by software
was the case of Therac-25, a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine. In that case, due to race conditions in the software
, sometimes the machine pumped out massive doses of radiation which resulted in injuries like radiation poisoning and burns and death due
to said radiation.</p>

<p>So as we can see, while software has been very helpful in our lives, it can cause serious trouble if mishandled.</p>
